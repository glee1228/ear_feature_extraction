* Input: Binary edge image of an ear image, segment length T.

* Output:Umax, Lmax, Llb, uls, urs and lls.

1  Search maximum EHL by computing the longest distance between ear edge points and obtain Umax, Lmax.
2  Select T points on either side of Umax to determine the segments uls and urs.
3  Similarly, Select T points on left side of Lmax to obtain lls.

* Input:Umax, Lmax, Llb, Ulb and Urb.

* Output: FVi (i = 1, 2, â€¦, 6).

1  Take the distance from Umax to Lmax (the length of maximum EHL) as FV1.
2  Search the minimum EHL between upper region (uls and urs) and lower region (lls) and obtain Umin and Lmin. The distance from Umin to Lmin is denoted as FV2.
3  Take the summation and ratio of FV1 and FV2 to obtain FV3 and FV4, respectively.
4  Find the middle point Cmax of maximum EHL, compute the shortest distance from Cmax to the left outer helix region and get line segment CI. Then ratio of both FV1 and FV2 to the length of CI are taken as FV5 and FV6, respectively.
